// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

sum of a and b = (a+b)


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

IF x (is even) => perform this action
	ELSE ((this will happen if the number is not even)) => perform this other action

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) accept input for 5 numbers assigned to a, b, c, d and e. Each number will be assigned one letter. a=2 b=5 c=7 d=3 e=9
b) average = ((a+b+c+d+e)/5)
c) min (a, b, c, d, e) max (a, b, c, d, e)
d) The average of the 5 numbers is 5.2. The min is 2 and max is 9.
